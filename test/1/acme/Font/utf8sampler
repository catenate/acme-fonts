Poetry

From Laȝamon's Brut (The Chronicles of England, Middle English,
West Midlands):

	An preost wes on leoden, Laȝamon was ihoten
	He wes Leovenaðes sone -- liðe him be Drihten.
	He wonede at Ernleȝe at æðelen are chirechen,
	Uppen Sevarne staþe, sel þar him þuhte,
	Onfest Radestone, þer he bock radde.
